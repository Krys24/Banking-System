# Banking-System
This is a simple banking system made in Python using OOP, compiled and ran PyCharm. 

Firstly run the program to display a standard user menu. If you are a first time customer press 1. If you are an old or returning customer press 2, otherwise press 3 to exit. If you are a new customer you will be required to fill in relevant details to be stored within our database (text file). However if you are an old or returning customer you will be required to enter your existing customer id to login to your account. If you do not remember your customer id, make a new account. 

All the bank information is stored in three external files: customers.txt, accounts.txt, accountsTransactions.txt.

Once you fill in relevant information you will be greeted by the banks user menu. You will now have to press 1 to create a bank account. If your age is 18 or over 18 you will be assigned a checking account otherwise you will be assigned a savings account. Once you do this feel free to play around with other options like deposit, transfer, withdraw and balance.
